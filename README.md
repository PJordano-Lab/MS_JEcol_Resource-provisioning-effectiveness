Using a sample of Atlantic rainforest avian frugivores we analyze fruit effectiveness as a nutritional food resource for seed dispersing birds, i.e., Resource-Provisioning Effectiveness (RPE), an overlooked aspect of seed dispersal effectiveness. We found ample variation in RPE among plant species, given not just variation in fruit design and nutrient content but also in fruit availability, accessibility and other features that determine how rewarding a fruit resource is for the frugivore. Yet fruit species show consistent RPE values despite highly variable outcomes of interactions with different avian frugivores.
